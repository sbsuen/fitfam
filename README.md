# FitFam
* [Introduction]()
##Introduction

FitFam is an application created to allow a user to create workouts from a
library of predefined exercises. Each workout may be time based or rep based.

This project is being done primarily as a way for me to familiarize
myself with Spring Boot and MongoDB

**NOTE: This application is still very much under construction**
